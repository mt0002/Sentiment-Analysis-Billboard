# Sentiment Analysis on top Billboard Songs

This repository contains code for my Natural Language Processing project. The project topic surrounded top Billboard songs
from the last 50 years and their sentiment. I created a sentiment analysis and ran it on 5 decades wortth of top 
Billboard songs to look into how sentiment scores of lyrics have changed through the years. 

I have also contained a write up for this project as well as the dataset.
